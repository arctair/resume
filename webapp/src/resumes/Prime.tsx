      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Your push to build processing for pharmacy rebates and client
        payments caught my attention and I am very interested in helping
        you deliver with focus on collaboration, quality and speed. I am a
        life-long geek with a knack for experimentation and experience in
        JVM programming, collaborative practices, and quality-driven
        practices. I am most effective on a team of members that seek to
        deeply understand and by understood by others.

        This rÃ©sumÃ© is a very brief summary of my education and experience
        and serves as a conversation starter for us. I am happy to discuss
        my experience or thoughts on anything not listed here.
