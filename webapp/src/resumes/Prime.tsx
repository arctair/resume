        <p>
          Your push to build processing for pharmacy rebates and client
          payments at Prime Therapeutics caught my attention and I am very
          interested in helping you deliver with focus on collaboration,
          quality and speed. I am a life-long geek with a knack for
          experimentation and experience in JVM programming, collaborative
          practices, and quality-driven practices. I am most effective on a
          team of members that seek to deeply understand and be understood
          by others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This rÃ©sumÃ© is a very brief summary of my experience and serves
          as a conversation starter for us. I am happy to discuss my
          experience or thoughts on anything not listed here.
