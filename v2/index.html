    <header> Introduction </header>
    <p>
        I am a free agent and I have been made curious about Developer Productivity work opportunities at
        Thrivent. I am enthusiastic to learn about your initiatives and in what areas you are looking for
        help. This document serves as a conversation starter about your objectives and how I could help meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many ways to build software done right. The teams to which I have contributed have had great success
        employing many more much smaller steps to tackle large objectives. This is the kind of community I seek to
        build and join. If this style or mindset resonates with you then I expect we could have a great partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am living and working from Kirkland, Washington. I am consistent with aligning my remote
        availability and collaboration to those working in Central +5/+6 timezone. My internet speed is
        symmetric gigabit and latency to Minneapolis is typically less than 90ms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I may contribute more than fourty hours per week if authorized and my availability allows; however, I will not
        recognize mandates beyond this limit.
